# Draig: version control tool for my personal server.

Draig is my attempt to create a version control system for my personal server I'm building. It needs to be simple enough that a 10 year old version of me could understand how to use it.

I could use git, but I feel like creating my own and simpler one, custom to my needs and nothing else.

I'm writing this in Rust because it sounds fun.
